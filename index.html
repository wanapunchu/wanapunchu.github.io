        <p>Hi! My name is Sabine (she/her). I'm a junior at MIT majoring in math with minors in physics and political science. At the moment, I'm most interested in creative writing, sustainability/environmental justice, education, and investing for social impact. I also have a diverse research background in math, nuclear engineering, and astronomy.</p>
        <p>I blog on my <a href="https://wanapunchu.substack.com/">Substack</a>, which includes short fiction, informal life updates, and longer personal essays. In addition, I recently joined MIT's student newspaper <i>The Tech</i>; you can find my articles <a href="https://thetech.com/authors/sabine-chu">here</a>. Finally, <a href="https://infinitemagazine.mit.edu/"><i>Infinite Magazine</i></a> only comes out once a year, but I'm proud of the writing, modelling, and design work I've done there.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to reach out, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:srchu@mit.edu">srchu[at]mit[dot]edu</a>.</p>
