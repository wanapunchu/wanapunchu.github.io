        <p>Hi! My name is Sabine (she/her).
            I'm a junior at MIT majoring in math with minors in physics and political science.
            The classes I've taken so far are listed on a separate <a href="classes.html">page</a>.
            I also have a diverse research background in math, materials science, and astronomy.
            If you're interested in reading more about my research, go <a href="research.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the moment, I'm most interested in creative writing, sustainability/environmental justice, education, and investing for social impact.
            More generally, I hope to pursue a career combining service and storytelling that will allow me to learn constantly.
        </p>
        <p>I blog on my <a href="https://wanapunchu.substack.com/">Substack</a>, which includes short fiction, informal life updates, and longer personal essays.
            In addition, I recently joined MIT's student newspaper <i>The Tech</i>; you can find my articles <a href="https://thetech.com/authors/sabine-chu">here</a>.
            Also, <a href="https://infinitemagazine.mit.edu/"><i>Infinite Magazine</i></a> only comes out once a year, but I'm proud of the writing, modelling, and design work I've done there.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time, I read, listen to music, run, and bake.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to reach out, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:srchu@mit.edu">srchu[at]mit[dot]edu</a>.</p>
