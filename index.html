<h1>About</h1>
<p>
    Hi! My name is Sabine (she/her).
    I'm a junior at MIT majoring in math and minoring in urban studies.
    The classes I've taken so far are listed on a separate <a href="classes.html">page</a>.
    I also have a diverse research <a href="research.html">background</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I blog on my <a href="https://wanapunchu.substack.com/">Substack</a>, which includes short fiction, informal life updates, and longer personal essays.
    In addition, I recently joined MIT's student newspaper <i>The Tech</i>; you can find my articles at this <a href="https://thetech.com/authors/sabine-chu">link</a>.
    Also, <a href="https://infinitemagazine.mit.edu/"><i>Infinite Magazine</i></a> only comes out once a year, but I'm proud of the writing, modeling, and design I've done there.
    There's a <a href="selected-writing.html">highlights</a> page on this website for my best work.
</p>
<p>
    If you'd like to reach out, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:srchu@mit.edu">srchu[at]mit[dot]edu</a>.
