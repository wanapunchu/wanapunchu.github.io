            Hi! I'm name is Sabine (she/her).
            I grew up in New York City, but for the past 2.5 years, I've been studying <a href="https://math.mit.edu/">math</a>
            and <a href="https://dusp.mit.edu/">urban planning</a> at MIT.
            Outside class, I like to read, run, listen to music, and bake.
            I've listed a few other things I enjoy (mainly books) on a separate <a href="favorites">page</a>.
            Mostly, I care about people and language, in that order, but more specifically,
            recently I've been thinking a lot about...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Constrained verse forms, what fiction ought to represent, making writing breathe</li>
            <li>Environmental justice, public transit, effective allyship, sidewalks</li>
            <li>Innovation without the jargon, enabling more equitable access to capital, the roles of philanthropy vs. advocacy</li>
            <li>If there are any objective metrics behind "good" questions, sincerity, Zoom's general awfulness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            At some point, I'll update the <a href="goals">goals</a> page.
            Overall, this website is very much a work in progress, but I'm hoping that it will help me
            to a) improve at webdev, b) get more organized, and c) keep myself honest.
        </p>

            I look like this: <br>
