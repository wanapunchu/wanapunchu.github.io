            Hi! My name is Sabine (she/her).
            I'm a junior at MIT studying math and urban planning.
            Outside class, I like to read, run, listen to music, and bake.
            Right now, I'm thinking a lot about...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Constrained verse forms, what fiction ought to represent, making writing breathe</li>
            <li>Environmental justice, public transit, effective community-building, sidewalks</li>
            <li>Innovation without the jargon, enabling more equitable access to capital, the roles of philanthropy and advocacy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I blog on my <a href="https://wanapunchu.substack.com/">Substack</a>, which includes short fiction, informal life updates, and longer personal essays.
            In addition, I recently joined MIT's student newspaper <i>The Tech</i>; you can find my articles at this <a href="https://thetech.com/authors/sabine-chu">link</a>.
            Also, <a href="https://infinitemagazine.mit.edu/"><i>Infinite Magazine</i></a> only comes out once a year, but I'm proud of the writing, modeling, and design I've done there.
            There's a <a href="writing">highlights</a> page on this website for my best work.
        </p>
        <p>
            I haven't gotten around to making a page for my CV, but the classes I've taken so far are listed <a href="classes">here</a>.
            I also have a diverse research <a href="research">background</a>.
