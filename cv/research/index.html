        This page details the more technical research I've done.
        I'm not currently planning on attending grad school for any of the subjects below,
        but these experiences taught me a bunch about grit, problem-solving, and teamwork,
        and I'm eternally grateful to all my mentors and colleagues.
        Happy to discuss any of the following, though I might be a bit rusty!
    </p>
    <h2>Math</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout 2024, I studied the topology of free boundary minimal surfaces in the unit ball with Dr. Giada Franz.
        A preprint of our paper is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16785">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In summer 2024, I worked with Christine Gao and Ananya Prasanna under Professor Alex Wright
        and Dr. George Domatat at the University of Michigan REU.
        We studied geometric group theory, with particular interest in nonhyperbolic graphs with Out(F<sub>n</sub>) actions.
        Fun fact: if you go onto the REU seminar <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/math-reu-seminars/home">website</a>,
        you can see me with blond hair (unusual) standing in a river (also unusual).
    </p>
    <h2>Materials Science</h2>
    <p>
        I spent the summer of 2023 programming a Python-based hardware-software interface for a position-sensitive
        neutron detector at the MIT Nuclear Reactor Laboratory supervised by Dr. Boris Khaykovich and Dr. Sean Fayfar.
        You can find the GitHub repository for the project <a href="https://github.com/MIT-NRL/pyNEUNET-Detector">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Astronomy</h2>
    <p>
        In high school, I researched the magnetic activity of low-mass stars in Professor Marcel Agüeros' group
        at Columbia University under the supervision of Dr. Alejandro Núñez.
        This work resulted in an AAS <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/abef06">conference proceeding</a>
        and was incorporated in a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad117e/meta">paper</a> in the ApJ.
